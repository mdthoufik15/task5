Loaded the dataset and examined its shape, structure, and summary statistics.

Checked for missing values and duplicate entries to assess data quality.

Performed univariate analysis:

Analyzed individual columns like Survived, Age, and Sex using value counts, histograms, and boxplots.

Conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis:

Explored how survival varied by Sex, Pclass, and Age.

Created visualizations like count plots and heatmaps to detect patterns and correlations.

Grouped data to calculate averages and survival rates across categories.

Summarized key findings, such as:

Females and passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates.

There were missing values in columns like Age.

A clear class-based and gender-based pattern influenced survival.

Finally, the analysis was prepared in Google Colab and exported as a PDF report for sharing and documentation purposes.
